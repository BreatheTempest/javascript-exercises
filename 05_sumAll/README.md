# Exercise 05 - sumAll

Implement a function that takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every number between(and including) them:

```javascript
sumAll(1, 4); // returns the sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 which is 10
```

## Hints

Think about how you would do this on pen and paper and then how you might translate that process into code:

- make sure you pay attention to the function parameters
- create a variable to hold the final sum
- loop through the given numbers ([link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration))
- on each iteration add the number to the sum
- return the sum after finishing the loop

People do worry but for all the wrong reasons
At the same time, because they worry too much and don't trust doctors, they make questionable decisions
So in a way they worry too little to make correct assessments

Truth be told, there is a merit to not trusting doctors
but that's a bad reason to go and take first article in google for granted

One of the most blatant examples is people taking antibiotics when they have a cold.
You shouldn't really do this. Antibiotics are damaging for your health and pretty useless against cold.

So if you can't find a good medical specialist you should do a proper research before taking anything, especially something serious like antibiotics.
